    <h2>Vegetarian Omelette</h2>
    <p>
        To make a veggie omelette, dice 1 cup of your favorite vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, over medium-high heat, saute vegetables and garlic in olive oil
        until soft, about 3-5 minutes depending on vegetables you choose.
    </p>
    <p>Set them aside to use later.</p>
    <h2>Bacon Omlette</h2>
    <p>
        To make a bacon omelette, begin by cooking the bacon, garlic and onion over
        medium heat until bacon is cooked and onion is soft (5-8 minutes). Set aside.
    </p>
    <p>You can use breakfast sausage in place of bacon</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Begin by whisking the eggs vigorously until they are homogenous (uniform throughout)
            This step is incredibly important, you want to beat those egges until there are
            no pieces of whites separated from the yolks. Then, whisk in the salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, melt the butter in an 8" nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.
            It's very important that you use an 8" pan. If you use a larger pan the omelet will
            be too thin, a smaller pan will yield a very thick omelet. Then, add the whisked eggs
            and swirl them in the pan until they are evenly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin
            to set. Please don't rush the process, low heat is important when cooking
            omelettes so they don't overcook.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly
            and swirl the pan so that any uncooked eggs on the top pour over the sides
            to the edges of the pan and cook.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then, sprinkle the cheese over the top of the omelette and add the toppings
            on one half of the omelette. Then, gently fold other half over the toppings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with a side of oven roasted potatoes and oven baked bacon!
        </li>
    </ol>
